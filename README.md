I was tasked via Frontend Mentor, to build out a QR code card that was optimized for both mobile and desktop. The goal was to closely match the provide design file.

## My process
I closely reviewed the Figma design file, and I reviewd the design guide to matche expected output. I built out the HTML structure and started with a mobile first approach. I used responsive tactics like max-width to optimize for desktop. I used CSS Flexbox and DevTools to closely match design!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to take a design from Figma and reproduce the desired product to an offical outcome using HTML and CSS. This was the first time, I was actually given specs to produce a product. Very exciting!



### Continued development

I plan to continue my knowledge in Responsive design. Although, this is not my first time using HTML or CSS. I hope to develop professional skills to only furthur improve myself in these technologies. I am currently getting better with JavaScript and the plan is to learn some awesome Frameworks!
